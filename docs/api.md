In programming, a loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition holds or for a fixed range.

Common loop forms include for and while; in these examples, we iterate from 0 up to a target number and print each value.

**Language chosen for all examples:** go

## Example Code 1

This code prints the integers from 0 to 1.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    n := 1
    for x := 0; x <= n; x++ {
        fmt.Println(x)
    }
}
```

## Example Code 2

This code prints the integers from 0 to 2.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    n := 2
    for x := 0; x <= n; x++ {
        fmt.Println(x)
    }
}
```

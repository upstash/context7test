# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 4cgu852k00y-mfx5oyi1

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Bash: Count Files

```bash
FILES=$(ls | wc -l)

```

In programming, a loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition holds or for a fixed range.

Common loop forms include for and while; in these examples, we iterate from 0 up to a target number and print each value.

**Language chosen for all examples:** javascript

## Example Code 1

This code prints the integers from 0 to 1.

```javascript
function writeZeroToN(n) {
  for (let x = 0; x <= n; x++) {
    console.log(x);
  }
}
writeZeroToN(1);
```

## Example Code 2

This code prints the integers from 0 to 2.

```javascript
function writeZeroToN(n) {
  for (let x = 0; x <= n; x++) {
    console.log(x);
  }
}
writeZeroToN(2);
```

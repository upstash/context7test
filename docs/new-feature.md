# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** j62sbppmj4-mif7ucgd

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## JavaScript: Sum Array Elements

This snippet demonstrates summing the numbers in an array using JavaScript's reduce. It showcases a concise, functional approach.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = nums.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(total);
```


## Bash: Count Files

Counts files in the current directory using common shell tools.

```bash
FILES=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Files: $FILES"
```

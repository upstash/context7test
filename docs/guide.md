# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 5mphzbk5imo-mgr3i5t1

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Haskell: Filter and Map

A minimal Haskell example filtering odd numbers and squaring them.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print $ map (^2) $ filter odd [1..10]
```

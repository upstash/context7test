# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 6933x75yxdr-mjxbxqd2

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## JavaScript: Sum Array Elements

This snippet demonstrates summing the numbers in an array using JavaScript's reduce. It showcases a concise, functional approach.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = nums.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(total);
```


## SQL: Group and Order

SQL query that groups by name and orders by count descending.

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM users
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY c DESC;
```


## Rust: Read Lines

Reads lines from stdin and echoes them in Rust. Highlights ownership-light IO usage.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};
fn main(){
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    for line in stdin.lock().lines() {
        println!("{}", line.unwrap());
    }
}
```

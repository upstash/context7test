# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** cr8y1h76mls-mgijgr4k

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Scala: List Pipeline

Uses Scala collections to filter and map a list with a clear pipeline.

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val nums = List(1,2,3,4,5)
    val oddsSquared = nums.filter(_ % 2 == 1).map(n => n*n)
    println(oddsSquared)
  }
}
```


## PHP: JSON Response

Outputs a JSON response in PHP for a simple API endpoint. Illustrates header setting and encoding.

```php
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode(['status' => 'ok', 'time' => time()]);
```

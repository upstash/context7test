# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 9ymajv56s1-mk4iojh4

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Kotlin: Data Class Copy

Demonstrates Kotlin data classes and the copy method. Encourages immutable-style updates.

```kotlin
data class User(val id:Int, val name:String, val active:Boolean)
fun main(){
  val u1 = User(1, "Ada", true)
  val u2 = u1.copy(active = false)
  println(u2)
}
```


## Julia: Comprehension

Julia list comprehension generating cubes of a range.

```julia
nums = 1:5
cubes = [n^3 for n in nums]
println(cubes)
```


## Scala: List Pipeline

Uses Scala collections to filter and map a list with a clear pipeline.

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val nums = List(1,2,3,4,5)
    val oddsSquared = nums.filter(_ % 2 == 1).map(n => n*n)
    println(oddsSquared)
  }
}
```

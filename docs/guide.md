# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 6o1rrsl5kq3-mko5gijc

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Swift: Map and Filter

Demonstrates Swift's map and filter on arrays for concise transformation.

```swift
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
let evensDoubled = nums.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }
print(evensDoubled)
```


## SQL: Group and Order

SQL query that groups by name and orders by count descending.

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM users
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY c DESC;
```


## R: Vector Arithmetic

Simple R vector example computing squares of a sequence.

```r
nums <- 1:5
squares <- nums^2
print(squares)
```

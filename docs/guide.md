In programming, a loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition holds or for a fixed range.

Common loop forms include for and while; in these examples, we iterate from 0 up to a target number and print each value.

**Language chosen for all examples:** python

## Example Code 1

This code prints the integers from 0 to 1.

```python
def write_zero_to_n(n):
    for x in range(n + 1):
        print(x)

write_zero_to_n(1)
```

## Example Code 2

This code prints the integers from 0 to 2.

```python
def write_zero_to_n(n):
    for x in range(n + 1):
        print(x)

write_zero_to_n(2)
```

## Example Code 3

This code prints the integers from 0 to 3.

```python
def write_zero_to_n(n):
    for x in range(n + 1):
        print(x)

write_zero_to_n(3)
```

## Getting Started

To begin using this system, you'll need to understand the basic concepts and architecture. Our system is designed to be flexible and extensible, supporting multiple programming languages and documentation formats.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Git for version control
- A modern text editor or IDE

### Basic Setup

```python
# Python example with comprehensive error handling
def hello(name=None):
    """
    Generate a greeting message.
    
    Args:
        name (str, optional): The name to greet. Defaults to 'World'.
    
    Returns:
        str: A formatted greeting message.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If name is not a string or None.
    """
    if name is not None and not isinstance(name, str):
        raise TypeError("Name must be a string")
    
    greeting_name = name if name else "World"
    return f"Hello from Python, {greeting_name}!"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(hello())  # Output: Hello from Python, World!
    print(hello("Context7"))  # Output: Hello from Python, Context7!
```

## Installation

Installation instructions would go here in a real project. This section demonstrates how documentation should be structured for optimal parsing.

## Configuration

Configuration details and examples would be documented here, showing various options and their effects on system behavior.

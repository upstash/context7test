In programming, a loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition holds or for a fixed range.

Common loop forms include for and while; in these examples, we iterate from 0 up to a target number and print each value.

**Language chosen for all examples:** rust

## Example Code 1

This code prints the integers from 0 to 1.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 1;
    for x in 0..=n {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
```

## Example Code 2

This code prints the integers from 0 to 2.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 2;
    for x in 0..=n {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
```

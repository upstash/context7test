# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** qbh8jvpaaie-mlr4nlnb

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## TypeScript: Typed User Model

This example shows a strongly-typed user interface and a function that formats user info. It highlights TypeScript's type safety.

```typescript
interface User { id: number; name: string; active: boolean }
function formatUser(u: User): string { return `${u.id}:${u.name}:${u.active}` }
console.log(formatUser({ id: 1, name: 'Ada', active: true }));
```


## Go: HTTP Server

A minimal HTTP server in Go that responds with a greeting. It demonstrates net/http usage.

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)
func main(){
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from Go!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

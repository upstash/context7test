In programming, a loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition holds or for a fixed range.

Common loop forms include for and while; in these examples, we iterate from 0 up to a target number and print each value.

**Language chosen for all examples:** java

## Example Code 1

This code prints the integers from 0 to 1.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 1;
    for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```

## Example Code 2

This code prints the integers from 0 to 2.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 2;
    for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```

## Example Code 3

This code prints the integers from 0 to 3.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 3;
    for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```

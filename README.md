# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** szxoo1uto48-mhf848ts

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Bash: Count Files

Counts files in the current directory using common shell tools.

```bash
FILES=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Files: $FILES"
```


## Ruby: Word Count

Counts word frequencies in a sentence using Rubyâ€™s expressive standard library. Simple and readable.

```ruby
text = "to be or not to be"
counts = Hash.new(0)
text.split.each { |w| counts[w] += 1 }
puts counts
```


## Java: Stream Map/Filter

Shows Java streams to map and filter a list, producing a concise pipeline. Demonstrates modern Java idioms.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
    List<Integer> doubledEvens = nums.stream()
      .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
      .map(n -> n * 2)
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
    System.out.println(doubledEvens);
  }
}
```

# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** or4rcnzdmc-mhmbbi5s

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Elixir: Enum Pipeline

Elixir pipeline that filters even numbers and inspects the result.

```elixir
nums = 1..10 |> Enum.to_list()
evens = Enum.filter(nums, fn n -> rem(n, 2) == 0 end)
IO.inspect(evens)
```


## JavaScript: Sum Array Elements

This snippet demonstrates summing the numbers in an array using JavaScript's reduce. It showcases a concise, functional approach.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = nums.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(total);
```


## Swift: Map and Filter

Demonstrates Swift's map and filter on arrays for concise transformation.

```swift
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
let evensDoubled = nums.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }
print(evensDoubled)
```

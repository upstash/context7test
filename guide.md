# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** lpzt6wayfg-mfem1bgz

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## PHP: JSON Response

Outputs a JSON response in PHP for a simple API endpoint. Illustrates header setting and encoding.

```php
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode(['status' => 'ok', 'time' => time()]);
```


## Bash: Count Files

Counts files in the current directory using common shell tools.

```bash
FILES=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Files: $FILES"
```

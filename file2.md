# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** 4hm0xhb71kp-mko2dqyw

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Dart: Map Over List

Dart example mapping over a list and printing the result.

```dart
void main() {
  final nums = [1,2,3,4,5];
  final tripled = nums.map((n) => n * 3).toList();
  print(tripled);
}
```


## JavaScript: Sum Array Elements

This snippet demonstrates summing the numbers in an array using JavaScript's reduce. It showcases a concise, functional approach.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = nums.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
console.log(total);
```

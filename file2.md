# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** a3955zzx5qg-miiylfpo

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Swift: Map and Filter

Demonstrates Swift's map and filter on arrays for concise transformation.

```swift
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
let evensDoubled = nums.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }
print(evensDoubled)
```


## PHP: JSON Response

Outputs a JSON response in PHP for a simple API endpoint. Illustrates header setting and encoding.

```php
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode(['status' => 'ok', 'time' => time()]);
```

# Auto-generated Test Document

This file is generated for E2E parsing.

**Document ID:** y25w4dujfto-mi4ovueb

This document contains a variety of concise, self-contained code examples across multiple programming languages, demonstrating common patterns, data structures, I/O, and control flow to exercise parsing in a realistic yet compact way.

Each example includes a short description followed by a fenced code block.

Where helpful, examples may include brief variations in syntax or structure so the parser encounters a wider range of constructs across different ecosystems.

## Bash: Count Files

Counts files in the current directory using common shell tools.

```bash
FILES=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Files: $FILES"
```


## SQL: Group and Order

SQL query that groups by name and orders by count descending.

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM users
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY c DESC;
```
